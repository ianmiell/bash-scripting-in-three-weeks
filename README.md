# Bash Scripting in Three Weeks

## What It Is

An three week O'Reilly course to take you from beginner to advanced in bash scripting, and prepare you for a career writing shell scripts.

## What You Need

You will need a terminal to run on, or can use [katacoda](https://katacoda.com/courses/centos/playground)

## Structure

Each week is a folder in this repo, and each week contains the commands that are planned to be run (the course itself may deviate from this) in the `commands` folder, and exercises in the `exercises` folder.
