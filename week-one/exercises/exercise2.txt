PART I
======
Write a script called `100files.sh` that creates 100 files in a shell script.

The files should be called 0.txt, 1.txt ... 99.txt and be placed in a `100files` folder.


PART II
=======
Write an executable script called `nfiles.sh` that creates n files in a shell script, where n is a number passed in as an argument.

The files should be called 1.txt, 2.txt ... n.txt and be placed in a folder called `nfiles`

Don't worry about error handling, you can assume the input is a number.
